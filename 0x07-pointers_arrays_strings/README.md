# Pointers, Arrays and Strings

This project contains __C__ tasks for learning about pointers, arrays and strings.

## Tasks Completed

+ [x] 0\. memset<br/>_**0-memset.c**_ contains a function that fills memory with a constant byte.
+ [x] 1\. memcpy<br/>_**1-memcpy.c**_ contains a function that copies memory area.
+ [x] 2\. strchr<br/>_**2-strchr.c**_ contains a function that locates a character in a string.
+ [x] 3\. strspn<br/>_**3-strspn.c**_ contains a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
+ [x] 4\. strpbrk<br/>_**4-strpbrk.c**_ contains a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
+ [x] 5\. strstr<br/>_**5-strstr.c**_ contains a function that locates a substring.
+ [x] 6\. Chess is mental torture<br/>_**7-print_chessboard.c**_ contains a function that prints the chessboard.
+ [x] 7\. The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire<br/>_**8-print_diagsums.c**_ contains a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
+ [x] 8\. Double pointer, double fun<br/>_**100-set_string.c**_ contains a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
+ [x] 9\. My primary goal of hacking was the intellectual curiosity, the seduction of adventure<br/>_**101-crackme_password**_ contains the password for the [crackme2](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x06.c) executable.
