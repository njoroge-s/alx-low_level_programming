# Pointers, Arrays and Strings

This project contains __C__ tasks for learning about pointers, arrays and strings.

+ [x] 2\. strncpy<br/>_**2-strncpy.c**_ contains a function that copies a string.
+ [x] 3\. strcmp<br/>_**3-strcmp.c**_ contains a function that compares two strings.
+ [x] 4\. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy<br/>_**4-rev_array.c**_ contains a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
