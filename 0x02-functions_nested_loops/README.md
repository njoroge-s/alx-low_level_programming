# Functions And Nested Loops

This project contains __C__ tasks for learning functions and nested loops.

## Tasks Completed

+ [x] 0\. _putchar_<br/>_**0-holberton.c**_ prints `Holberton`, followed by a new line.
+ [x] 1\. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game<br/>_**1-alphabet.c**_ prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
+ [x] 2\. 10 x alphabet<br/>_**2-print_alphabet_x10.c**_ prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
+ [x] 3\. islower<br/>_**3-islower.c**_ checks for lowercase character.
+ [x] 4\. isalpha<br/>_**4-isalpha.c**_ checks for alphabetic character.
+ [x] 5\. Sign<br/>_**5-sign.c**_ prints the sign of a number.
+ [x] 6\. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you<br/>_**6-abs.c**_ computes the absolute value of an integer.
+ [x] 7\. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important<br/>_**7-print_last_digit.c**_ prints the last digit of a number.
+ [x] 8\. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life<br/>_**8-24_hours.c**_ prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
+ [x] 9\. Learn your times table<br/>_**9-times_table.c**_ prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
+ [x] 10\. a + b<br/>_**10-add.c**_ adds two integers and returns the result.
+ [x] 11\. Holberton School, 98 Battery Street, the OG<br/>_**11-print_to_98.c**_ prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`, followed by a new line.
+ [x] 12\. The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself<br/>_**100-times_table.c**_ prints the `n` times table, starting with 0.
+ [x] 13\. Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women<br/>_**101-natural.c**_ prints the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024` (excluded).
+ [x] 14\. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A<br/>_**102-fibonacci.c**_ prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`.
+ [x] 15\. Even Liber Abbaci<br/>_**103-fibonacci.c**_ finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms by considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000.
+ [x] 16\. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+<br/>_**104-fibonacci.c**_ finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers.
