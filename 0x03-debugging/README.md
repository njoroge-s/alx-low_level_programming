This project contains __C__ tasks for learning some debugging routines.

## Tasks Completed

+ [x] 0\. Multiple mains<br/>_**0-main.c**_ tests that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0`.
+ [x] 1\. Like, comment, subscribe<br/>_**1-main.c**_ shows a commented out code section that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
+ [x] 2\. 0 > 972?<br/>_**2-largest_number.c**_ prints the largest of three integers.
+ [x] 3\. Leap year<br/>_**3-print_remaining_days.c**_ converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
