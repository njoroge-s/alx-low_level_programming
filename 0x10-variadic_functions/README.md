This project contains __C__ tasks for learning about variadic functions.

## Tasks Completed

+ [x] 0\. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant<br/>_**[0-sum_them_all.c](0-sum_them_all.c)**_ contains a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.

+ [x] 3\. To be is a to be the value of a variable<br/>_**[3-print_all.c](3-print_all.c)**_ contains a function that prints anything.
+ [x] 4\. Real programmers can write assembly code in any language<br/>_**[100-hello_holberton.asm](100-hello_holberton.asm)**_ is a 64-bit program in assembly that prints `Hello, Holberton`, followed by a new line.
