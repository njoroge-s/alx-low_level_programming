# Structures and Typedef

This project contains __C__ tasks for learning about **structures** and **typedef**.

## Tasks Completed

+ [x] 0\. Poppy<br/>_**[dog.h](dog.h)**_ contains a new type `struct dog with the following elements.
  + `name`, type = `char *`
  + `age`, type = `float *`
  + `owner`, type = `char *`
+ [x] 1\. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself<br/>_**[1-init_dog.c](1-init_dog.c)**_ contains a function that initializes a variable of type `struct dog`.
+ [x] 2\. A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad<br/>_**[2-print_dog.c](2-print_dog.c)**_ contains a function that prints a `struct dog`.
+ [x] 3\. Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read<br/>_**[dog.h](dog.h)**_ defines a new type `dog_t` as a new name for the type `struct dog`.
